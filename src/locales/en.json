    "story1_content": "In the Kaliyuga, Lord Srinivasa manifested His miracles during the Pratishtha of this temple. This miracle was witnessed by thousands of devotees with their own eyes. On the auspicious day of Maha Kumbh Abhishek, the central Sanctum Shikra of Lord Srinivasa was adorned with Garuda, the vehicle of Lord Srinivasa, who circumnavigated the central Santorum thrice. This spectacle was witnessed by thousands of devotees and inspired them to pursue the Lord Srinivasa with unwavering devotion.",
    "story2_content": "Sri Mr. Shiv Prasad, renowned for his extensive experience in constructing temples under the Tirupati Devasthanams (TTD), commenced the reconstruction of the Lord's temple. His work encompassed the reconstruction of the gopuram of Lord Srinivasa, Sri Lakshmi Padmavati Ammavari Alayam, Dhwaja Stambham, Garuda Alwar Mandiram, Bhakta Hanuman Mandiram, Anugna Ganapathy Temple, and Kashi Viswanath Temple. On February 2, 2023, on the day of Maaga Shuddha Ekadashi, the temple underwent its Punah Pratishtha, and the Maha Kumbha Shikhara ceremony was performed by the temple priests, who had dedicated over two decades to the temple's service.",
    "story3_content": "During the performance of the Punah Prathista and Kumbh Abhishekam, Garuda Pakshi, the Vaahana of Lord Srinivasa returned and circumnavigated the central Santorum thrice, causing astonishment among the devotees. This remarkable incident prompted the entire temple to hail Lord Srinivasa with Govinda Namasmarana. The son of Lord Saraswati Sahasra Avadhani Shree Medasani Mohan Garu witnessed this divine miracle. Subsequently, the temple commenced performing rituals similar to those performed in Thirumala to Lord Balaji in the form of Vaikhanamsa Agama Shastra, Pavithrotsasvas, Vsanthotsavas, Shravana Nakshatra Kalyanam, Garuda Seva on Pournami, Pavitra Utsavalu, and Brahmotsavalu. Lord Swami, accompanied by Sri Lakshmi Padmavathi Annavaru, blesses the devotees with his divine grace."
