      "During the performance of the Punah Prathista and Kumbh Abhishekam, Garuda Pakshi, the Vaahana of Lord Srinivasa returned and circumnavigated the central Santorum thrice, causing astonishment among the devotees. This remarkable incident prompted the entire temple to hail Lord Srinivasa with Govinda Namasmarana. The son of Lord Saraswati Sahasra Avadhani Shree Medasani Mohan Garu witnessed this divine miracle. Subsequently, the temple commenced performing rituals similar to those performed in Thirumala to Lord Balaji in the form of Vaikhanamsa Agama Shastra, Pavithrotsasvas, Vsanthotsavas, Shravana Nakshatra Kalyanam, Garuda Seva on Pournami, Pavitra Utsavalu, and Brahmotsavalu. Lord Swami, accompanied by Sri Lakshmi Padmavathi Annavaru, blesses the devotees with his divine grace.",
